        Christofforo Suriano was the first Venetian envoy to the Dutch Republic.
        His arrival in The Hague marks the beginning of official Dutch-Venetian
        diplomatic relations. This digital edition presents all 725 letters sent
        by Suriano to the Venetian Senate between 1616 and 1623, totaling
        approximately 7,000 pages. His correspondence is of great importance for
        Dutch, Venetian, and European history in the first phase of the Thirty
        Yearsâ€™ War. For more information about the edition, see:{" "}
