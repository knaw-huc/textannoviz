        The letters are written in Italian. For a full text search, you will get
        the most complete results using Italian words and terms. You are also
        able to use English words or terms in the full text search, but then you
        will only search in the English summaries accompanying each letter.

        The aim of summaries is to provide an overview of the most important
        topics and themes covered by Suriano. In these summaries, you also get
        information about the various enclosed documents sent with the letters.

        The individuals mentioned in his letters have been identified as much as
        possible, and for each person we have been able to identify, a brief
        biography is provided. We are improving the search function for names of
        individuals. This is an ongoing and collaborative endeavour:
        improvements will be added in increments.
